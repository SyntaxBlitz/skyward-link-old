============

This is the repository a rails application I'm working on that will let you use an Internet-enabled smartphone to control a live Google Drive presentation. It's coming along nicely, but so far much of what I've written is still in the prototype stage. I'm creating the repository early with the hope that I'll get nagged about finishing this project, because it matters to me.
