============

This is the repository for a django application I'm working on that will let you use an Internet-enabled smartphone to control a live Google Drive presentation. It's coming along nicely, but so far much of what I've written is still in the prototype stage. I'm creating the repository early with the hope that I'll get nagged about finishing this project, because it matters to me.

This project, excluding its dependencies, is released under the MIT license by Timothy Aveni.

Installation
------------
This section will become more complete as more content is added to the repository.

The CLIENT_ID variable in static/index.js needs to be changed to the Google API client ID of the application.
