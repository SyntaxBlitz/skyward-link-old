============

This is the repository for an application I'm working on that will let you use an Internet-enabled smartphone to control a live Google Drive presentation.

It is currently a working prototype. The code in this repository is horribly out of date, but in the coming days, once I get a few things polished, I'll upload all of the code to this repository.

This project, excluding its dependencies, is released under the MIT license by Timothy Aveni.
